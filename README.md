### Quick Setup

Here are the quick setup steps:

* create a new project "Weapon Tutorial" using "3D" Template in Unity 2019.1.5f1

* set Color Space to "Linear" in the project settings

* add the Post Processing package (current version is 2.1.7)

* open Scenes > SampleScene

* hit play

* press space to toggle the weapon on and off

### Additional Info

* the shader graph is the one I posted in the [Amplify Shader Editor thread](https://forum.unity.com/threads/best-tool-asset-store-award-amplify-shader-editor-node-based-shader-creation-tool.430959/page-32#post-3147421)

  (Credits to "K Re" who did the glow effect graph tutorial for the unreal engine)
 
* you might want to add audio for the weapon on / off / loop / swing sound in the Weapon script settings; unfortunately I'm not allowed to provide them

* this works in 2018+

* the glow effect very much depends on your shader settings and the bloom post processing settings, adjust to your own preferences
